# OOPTutoring

Hi, My name is Eva (Le-En) Huang and I'm a second year CS major doing Tutoring on the side!
I have many students come to my sessions cluesless about OOP concepts. And in fact I was exactly
like this a year ago. I'm excited to have the opportunity to share my example code with you all.

Hope this repo helps you somehow along your road to CS.
